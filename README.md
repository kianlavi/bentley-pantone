# Bentley Pantone

Pantone is a rejiggering of what Royce Haynes made for [Ghost](http://ghost.org). As he put it, it's a "theme focusing on your content". I needed a new portfolio and I wanted to learn some JS, so I messed with what he had until it worked for me. Please forgive me if things don't make sense, I'm pretty green to this platform and how to build on it. 

Hopefully I'll update this often, as I'm planning on learning NodeJS and using this portfolio as my test bed. Feel free to [add a feature I'm not smart enough to implement](https://github.com/kianlavi/bentley-pantone/issues?state=open).

And I know the name is stupid, but I'm using a theme called ['rollsroyce'](https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce) on a platform called Ghost. And I design things. So calling it Bentley Phantom was just too cheesy. 

## How to install it

1. If you're hosted with Ghost, then just zip this baby up and upload it through their front-end. Otherwise, it's step 2 for you. 

2. Clickety-clack your way to Ghost's theme directory (ghost/content/themes)

3. Clone this repo there ``` git clone https://github.com/kianlavi/bentley-pantone "bentley-pantone"```

4. Restart your ghost installation.

5. Log into Ghost's configuration page and go to your Settings page. Select 'bentley-pantone' as the theme and save.

*Note:* [Email me](kianlavi@gmail.com) or [its original creator](roycehaynes@gmail.com)  if you have any issues.
